# Important

These files are not included in the project. They are here just in case AI model throws an error then to replace the entire main root with this.

## What exactly is this?
This was my first try in making this thing work, but at that time transformer was throw some error and it was due to version mismatch and after downgrading and upgrading many modules, I gave up that and made this fallback system.

Later on I made new folder and was able to get proper and compatible version for transformer and python to be used.

## Why you added it here?
I added here, because if someone is not able to understand what error is, or after amny tries the error persist then they can use this. Even without AI, it pretty much does the same thing. [It is also faster.]
